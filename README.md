A multi-class classification project to build and evaluate predictive models using various machine learning algorithms. These models aim to accurately classify data into multiple classes based on the provided features. The project involves the analysis of misclassification rates on both the training and test datasets, with the primary goal of achieving high accuracy in class prediction.

**About the Data** <br>
Source of the data: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/342/mice+protein+expression <br>
Data Owner: Clara Higuera, Katheleen Gardiner and Krzysztof Cios <br>
Data Description: <br>
The data set consists of the expression levels of 77 proteins/protein modifications
that produced detectable signals in the nuclear fraction of the cortex. There are 38
control mice and 34 trisomic mice (Down syndrome), for 72 mice. In the
experiments, 15 measurements were registered of each protein per sample/mouse.
Therefore, for control mice, there are 38x15, or 570 measurements, and for trisomic
mice, there are 34x15, or 510 measurements. The dataset contains a total of 1080
measurements per protein. Each measurement can be considered as an independent
sample/mouse. <br>
The eight classes of mice are described based on features such as genotype, behavior
and treatment. According to genotype, mice can be controlled or trisomic. According to
behavior, some mice have been stimulated to learn (context shock) and others have
not (shock-context) and in order to assess the effect of the drug memantine in
recovering the ability to learn in trisomic mice, some mice have been injected with
the drug and others have not.
